      <description>When The Digital Antiquarian released his System Shock retrospective earlier this year, I was in awe. System Shock was one of my favorite games back in the day, and yes, in the quarrel between id Software&amp;rsquo;s DOOM and Looking Glass&amp;rsquo;s System Shock, I was siding with the latter. I was so much more for immersion and storyline than shoot &amp;lsquo;em-ups. The Antiquarian article is excellent. If you&amp;rsquo;re into gaming history or, really, into computer&amp;rsquo;s history, I urge you to read it all.</description>
