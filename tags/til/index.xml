      <description>No matter how long I&amp;rsquo;ve possessed a Mac and how hard I try, there will always be a helpful keyboard shortcut hidden somewhere that I don&amp;rsquo;t know about.
Today I learned about holding the Option key while clicking on the Copy command in Finder. It activates the super-useful (and super-secret) &amp;ldquo;copy as pathname&amp;rdquo; feature.
I spotted this trick on Jamie Smith&amp;rsquo;s website, where other handy shortcuts (and the pretty gif above) reside.</description>

      <description>When Giulia came home from school today, she was anxious to tell me what she learned about a Viking King and his legacy. She told me the story of King Harald Gormsson, who ruled Denmark and Norway from c. 958 to c. 986. Harald is mainly known for introducing Christianity to Denmark and consolidating his rule over most Jutland and Zealand. However, what sparked my interest is that Harald was nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Bluetooth&amp;rdquo;, and, in 1997, the Bluetooth wireless specification design was named after him.</description>

      <title>Automatic deletion of older records in Postgres</title>

      <description>We have a Postgres cluster with a database for each user. Each database has a table that records events, and we want this table to only record the last 15 days.
If we were on MongoDB, we could use a capped collection, but we are in Postgres, which does not have equivalent functionality. In Postgres, you have to make do with something homemade. My first idea was to install a cron job in the system.</description>

      <title>Migrating a Windows 10 VM to Windows 11 in Parallels Desktop: a story of TPM chips and BIOS upgrades</title>

      <description>This weekend assignment was to upgrade a couple of old Windows 10 VMs to Windows 11 in Parallels Desktop 17. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do that right away because Windows Update was complaining about the lack of the TPM chip. A little research revealed that TPM chips only work on UEFI BIOS. To check which BIOS version was being used in my VMs, I used the msinfo32 (System Information) application. It showed the BIOS to be of &amp;ldquo;Legacy&amp;rdquo; type.</description>

      <title>How to automatically pull and deploy updated Docker images</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-automatically-pull-and-deploy-updated-docker-images/</link>

      <description>We want our test and production stacks to be automatically updated every time something new is pushed to the test or release branch. CI builds the docker image on successful test runs, then stores it in our private registry. But how do you automatically pull and deploy those updated images?
I looked into the Watchtower project, which is interesting. You add Watchtower to the stack, and it will diligently check for new versions of the images used by the containers in the stack, pulling, building and deploying as needed while the stack is up and running.</description>

      <description>Today I searched the internet for something, and the first result I got from @duckduckgo was a note I wrote months ago to my future self; how meta is that.
Learn in public, it gives superpowers1. Also, in recent years, adopting POSSE was the best thing I did for my personal development.

      <title>The American Style of quotation mark punctuation makes no sense</title>

      <description>Years ago, I translated an essay by Terry Windling, On Tolkien and Fairie-Stories, from American English to Italian. I remember arguing with the author about her use of periods in quotations. Each quotation would end with a period before the closing mark. I was puzzled. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that in Italy. More importantly, I read many English texts where the period was left outside the quotation itself. She insisted that her style was correct1.</description>

      <title>How to read Windows-1252 encoded files with .NETCore and .NET5&#43;</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-read-windows-1252-encoded-files-with-.netcore-and-.net5-/</guid>
      <description>Another day, another lesson learned: modern .NET does not support the Windows-1252 encoding out of the box. Today my colleague was happily porting a legacy NET4+ app to NET6. As usual, the port was super-easy; it would compile and run just fine, so he was surprised when the app crashed reading a few specific XML files. That&amp;rsquo;s when I was called in. A closer inspection revealed a pattern: all those crashing files were Windows 1252-encoded (the rest, a vast majority, were UTF-8.</description>

      <title>How to restore a single Postgres database from a pg_dumpall dump</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-restore-a-single-postgres-database-from-a-pg_dumpall-dump/</guid>
      <description>Today I learned how to restore a single Postgres database from a global dump generated with pg_dumpall. Now, pg_dumpall is handy when you want to back up an entire Postgres cluster. It will dump all databases and global objects in a single text file. In contrast, pg_dump, the go-to tool for Postgres backups, offers more control but only works with a single database and doesn&amp;rsquo;t dump global objects, such as the roles/users linked to the database.</description>

      <title>How to remove a file from Git history</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-remove-a-file-from-git-history/</guid>
      <description>Today I learned how to remove a file from a git repository while also cleaning it from the history. When you delete it with git rm or git rm --cached, tracks remain in the commit history (the reflog). That might not be a big deal, but if the file has sensitive contents that you want to disappear from version control entirely, then you also want it cleaned from the reflog. That&amp;rsquo;s when git filter-branch comes to the rescue.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall a tmux command, so I quickly reached for my trusted default search engine DuckDuckGo. I typed &amp;ldquo;tmux cheat sheet&amp;rdquo; because, well, once I found an excellent one which I wanted to summon again. To my surprise, the search result included an in-page cheat sheetâ€”a good one too.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time that DuckDuckGo surprises me like that. Need a new GUID? Search for it.

      <title>Custom default values for not existing dictionary items (and a lesson learned)</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/custom-default-values-for-not-existing-dictionary-items-and-a-lesson-learned/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/custom-default-values-for-not-existing-dictionary-items-and-a-lesson-learned/</guid>
      <description>When dealing with dictionaries, a typical problem is when an operation attempts to retrieve an element using a key that does not exist in the dictionary. In .NET, a KeyNotFoundException is raised, and that&amp;rsquo;s the desired behaviour in most circumstances. Sometimes, however, you know that your program will frequently try to retrieve keys that do not exist. In such cases, it is more efficient to use the TryGetValue method:
 This method returns the value associated with the specified key, if the key is found; otherwise, the default value for the type of the value parameter is returned (source)</description>

      <title>dotnet SmtpClient should not be used</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/dotnet-smtpclient-should-not-be-used/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/dotnet-smtpclient-should-not-be-used/</guid>
      <description>I am very late to the party, but today I learned that the good old dotnet SmptClient is considered obsolete and should not be used. Quoting the documentation:
 We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend using the SmtpClient class for new development because SmtpClient doesn&amp;rsquo;t support many modern protocols. Use MailKit or other libraries instead. (source)
 Interestingly, Microsoft is recommending a third-party open-source library as an alternative. I hope we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of that in the future.</description>

      <title>How to add an empty directory to a Git repository</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository/</guid>
      <description>How do you add an empty directory to a Git repository? It&amp;rsquo;s a classic, and yet, I have to look it up every single time. Git does not support this out of the box:
 Currently the design of the Git index (staging area) only permits files to be listed, and nobody competent enough to make the change to allow empty directories has cared enough about this situation to remedy it.</description>

      <title>Battling with SSH, cron jobs, and macOS Keyring</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/battling-with-ssh-cron-jobs-and-macos-keyring/</guid>
      <description>So today, I was setting up a cronjob on my trusty MacBook Pro. The goal was to backup some folders from a remote Linux server via rsync. The script is simple. It goes something like this:
rsync -avz -e &amp;quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_rsa_keyfile&amp;quot; myuser@myserver:remotedir/ ~/localdir/  Launched by hand, it works seamlessly. Call it from a cron job via crontab, and I get a permission denied error. I then enabled ssh -v option to gather a little intel on what was actually going on.</description>

      <title>How to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 07:05:25 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-shrink-a-wsl2-virtual-disk/</guid>
      <description>I discovered you can use the &amp;ldquo;diskpart&amp;rdquo; tool to compact a VHDX. This allows you to shrink a WSL2 virtual disk file, reclaiming disk space. It appeared to work for me without any data corruption, taking the file size down from 100GB to 15GB. (source)
 I adore Parallels &amp;ldquo;reclaim disk space&amp;rdquo; feature. Just the other day, I got back 70GB off my Windows Guest in a breeze. I&amp;rsquo;m coming from VirtualBox, where reclaiming disk space is a significant pain.</description>

      <title>Cleaning Up Your Postgres Database</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/cleaning-up-your-postgres-database/</guid>
      <description>I am an application/backend developer who has to quibble with databases more often than desired. I can get my way around Postgres pretty well, but I can always use a hint or two, especially when it comes to fine-tuning and performance.
I stumbled upon Cleaning Up Your Postgres Databases. It offers useful advice on spotting performance bottlenecks in your Postgres database. Take the cache and index hit queries, for example.</description>

      <title>How to increase upload file size in ASP.NET Core</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/how-to-increase-upload-file-size-in-asp.net-core/</guid>
      <description>Today I learned the hard way that since ASP.NET Core 2.0, the request body has acquired a default size limit at 30MB (~28.6 MiB).
 If the request body size exceeds the configured max request body size limit, the call to Request.Body.ReadAsync will throw an IOException. If this exception is uncaught, Kestrel will respond with a 413 Payload Too Large response and HttpSys will respond with a generic 500 Internal Server Error response (source).</description>
