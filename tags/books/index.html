    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>In this scholarly biography by Janet L. Nelson, Charlemagne is stripped back from the years of mythologizing and idolizing that have occurred since his death. He is presented as distinctly human, and this book is the first time I have felt I could reasonably understand Charlemagne as the man he was, not the man he has since been painted to be. Moreover, Nelson is excellent in her discussions of Charlemagne&rsquo;s wives and their roles. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-king-and-emperor-a-new-life-of-charlemagne/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>In this introduction to classical music, Jan Swafford explains the different musical periods and their differences. Each period has its introductory chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer, Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get into the contemporary era. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-language-of-the-spirit-an-introduction-to-classical-music/">&raquo;</a></p>

During his previous life around the world, Antoine has seen many places, met many interesting people, done exciting things. For the last three years, however, he&rsquo;s been alone in Bouville.

            <p>I happened across this book by pure chance. After having ice cream in our favourite place in Milano Marittima, my wife and I visited a small street market with all kinds of booths. Of course, there was a used book stand toward which I immediately gravitated. A quick scan revealed nothing of interest, so I moved along. But Serena, who arrived at the booth moments after I left, knew more. A simple, no-frills, cardboard-covered book which carried a giant PROUD 2BEA FLYER title on the spine caught her attention. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-proud-tobea-flyer/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Volker Ullrich&rsquo;s Eight Days in May describes the period from April 30, 1945, the day of Hitler&rsquo;s suicide, to May 8, the day of signing the German capitulation, with significant jumps backwards in time and some hops in the future. We&rsquo;re covering only eight days, and the dictator dies on day one. What essential events might ever have happened in such a short period?

Being the Tablet &ldquo;a daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture&rdquo;, it makes sense that a good part of the article focuses on Proust&rsquo;s ambivalence about his Jewishness. Still, there are many other interesting tidbits to be learned. <a class="read-more" href="/prousts-madeleine-was-originally-a-slice-of-toast/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Vera Gheno&rsquo;s &ldquo;Potere alle Parole&rdquo; (Power to the Words) is an essay on the importance of appropriate use of the (Italian) language, not just in written works but also and predominately in everyday life.
 What would we think of a person who, having a vast wardrobe of beautiful clothes, always wore the same suit out of laziness? These situations appear unlikely; yet, they are examples of the attitude that many have towards their language: they have access to an immense, incalculable patrimony, which out of indolence, or fear, or inexperience, they use partially. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-power-to-the-words/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The idea behind this book is fascinating. As the subtitle suggests, the book collects stories of rebel mountaineers of all kinds. Some chose to disobey orders; others built refuges of resistance, outposts of autonomy and laboratories of social innovation.
The collection is rich and varied. We go from the heretics who went with Fra Dolcino to the partisans who stopped the Nazi fascists in the mountains of Cuneo and Belluno, up to the contemporary movements against the high-speed train in the Susa Valley. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-alpi-ribelli-storie-di-montagna-resistenza-e-utopia/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>According to a famous and fortunate Homeric expression, words are winged, not so much like birds but rather like arrows, which cut the air quickly to go straight to the target and break through the listener&rsquo;s heart. The Greeks have always known that the word is used to convince and show truth and correctness. But they also know that it has a magical force in it: it can turn into a spell, capable of dominating and dragging the listener&rsquo;s soul; to bewitch like music and to heal like medicine; but, above all, to deceive and mislead. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-the-voice-of-the-sirens.-the-greeks-and-the-art-of-persuasion/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Robert Edison Fulton was the first solo round-the-world motorcycle tourer. He made his worldwide trip on a two-cylinder Douglas motorcycle between July 1932 and December 1933, more or less 90 years ago. On his way from London to the colonial Middle East, Fulton crossed Nazi Germany. Some of the countries and places he passed do not exist anymore. Most have changed dramatically; others, not so much. I suspect, for example, that his adventures in Syria, Afghanistan, or at the Indian-Pakistani borders might have been written today. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-one-man-caravan/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>What a fascinating read. It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.
 Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand. <a class="read-more" href="/the-real-book-of-jazz/">&raquo;</a></p>

 In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-the-tragedy-of-the-waleship-essex/">&raquo;</a></p>

After some research, Fulvio Tomizza&rsquo;s book, Materada, surfaced as a good fit to fill this gap. It&rsquo;s a semi-biographic historical novel set in the Istria of the author&rsquo;s youth. Fulvio Tomizza was born in Giurizzani di Materada, Istria, in 1935. He had to go through all the torments caused in that disputed area by Fascism first (forced Italianization, cultural suppression), and then by the Second World War and the terrible events that followed: the Foibe massacres and the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-materada/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Literary Hub has a great short interview with Ian McEwan.
 What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received? When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s, I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work. Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor. <a class="read-more" href="/you-have-to-write-as-though-your-parents-are-dead/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I came back to reading Shirley Jackson almost by coincidence. I had just finished watching The Haunting of Hill House, and, as I always do with stuff that tickles my curiosity, I was doing a little research on it. That&rsquo;s how I learned that the TV Series is loosely based on a novel by the same name written by&hellip; Shirley Jackson.
Still imbued by the TV Series&rsquo;s atmospheres, now knowing about its connection with Jackson, I was ready for another dive into her literature of psychological suspense and terror. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Water Dancer is the debut novel for Ta-Nehisi Coates, an author and journalist best known for his nonfiction works. Set in a slave plantation located in pre-civil war Virginia, this is a bold and ambitious story about slavery. From the editor website:
 Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-the-water-dancer/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I finished reading Erebus: The Story of a Ship by Michael Palin, an excellent book on the dramatic adventures of the HMS Erebus with her sister ship, the HMS Terror, first in James Clark Ross&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition of 1839-43, and then during Franklin’s ill-fated Arctic expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. I knew Michael Palin as a member of the Monty Python comedy group. As it turns out, since 1980, he has also made many travel documentaries and books. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-erebus-the-story-of-a-ship/">&raquo;</a></p>
