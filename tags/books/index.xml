      <title>Book Review: Thinking Fast and Slow</title>

      <description>This book stands up to its fame. It&amp;rsquo;s chock-full of precious insights on our decision-making and behavioral processes and how and why we humans are often capable of making informed yet awful decisions. The bad news is that we can hardly avoid most of these biases, no matter how hard we try and even if we know about them. So-called experts in the field are subject to these same biases: their short-term estimates and predictions can even be pretty good, but they will fail miserably in the long term, like any other man or woman.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Eichmann in Jerusalem. A Report on the Banality of Evil</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-eichmann-in-jerusalem.-a-report-on-the-banality-of-evil/</guid>
      <description>This book is not about the famous, daring, and in some ways fortunate capture of Eichmann in Buenos Aires in 1960, nor about the covert transfer of the Nazi officer to Israel. Instead, the volume recounts the 1961 trial in Jerusalem, which ended with the defendant being sentenced to death. Hannah Arendt followed the trial as a correspondent for The New Yorker. She took notes, studied the papers, and reconstructed the many witnesses&amp;rsquo; personal stories.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Finnish Fairy Tales</title>

      <description>Over the years, Iperborea, one of my favorite Italian publishers, has been publishing an unofficial Nordic Tales series. Their renowned nordic fiction series includes one fairy tale volume per year, usually published in December, just for Christmas. The first book was Lapland Tales in 2014, and then they continued with Danish, Icelandic, Swedish, Faroe, Norwegian, Greenlandic and then Finnish in 2021. I&amp;rsquo;ve been greedily reading each one of them, usually as my last book of the year.</description>

      <title>Three Good Books I Read in 2021</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/three-good-books-i-read-in-2021/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/three-good-books-i-read-in-2021/</guid>
      <description>This year I&amp;rsquo;ve read twenty-one books or 5903 pages. That&amp;rsquo;s fewer books than last year (28 / 8064), the year before (25 / 8394), and the one before that (30 / 8447). Heck, I must look back at 2014 to score a win in my very own yearly reading challenge. What surprises me is not much the number of books but the pages I read, which constitutes a more relevant metric.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Consider the Lobster</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-consider-the-lobster/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-consider-the-lobster/</guid>
      <description>I found a Consider the Lobster review on Goodreads that almost precisely matches my thoughts on DFW and the book. Hence, given the lazy Christmas-break mood I am in right now, I am conceding myself the right to copy-paste and edit David&amp;rsquo;s review right away.
I know of nobody else who writes as thoughtfully and intelligently as DFW. That he manages to write so informatively, with humor and genuine wit, on almost any subject under the sun is mind-blowing – it&amp;rsquo;s also why I am willing to forgive his occasional stylistic excesses.</description>

      <title>Book Review: About the Meaning of Life</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-about-the-meaning-of-life/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a regular philosophy reader, much less of self-improvement guides. I&amp;rsquo;m wary of the latter and too ignorant for the former. Yet, theologian Vito Mancuso has intrigued me for some time. I followed his podcast on the &amp;ldquo;Four Masters of Life&amp;rdquo;1 and found it excellent. In it, Mancuso discusses his four tutelary deities: &amp;ldquo;Socrates, the educator. Buddha, the physician. Confucius, the politician. Jesus, the prophet.&amp;rdquo; I also listened to some TV interviews where I always found him fascinating.</description>

      <title>Book Review: A useless man</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-a-useless-man/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-a-useless-man/</guid>
      <description>Sait Faik Abasıyanık is an acclaimed Turkish storyteller. A useless man is a collection of short stories that spans nearly two decades of the author&amp;rsquo;s output, offering a glimpse into his imaginative and troubled mind. His overflowing love for others (even sensual, with a preference for street kids) combined with a &amp;ldquo;mal de vivre&amp;rdquo; that pushes him towards self-destruction are apparent.
His passion for the most popular areas of Istanbul and, in contrast, the atavistic nostalgia for the simple life of the nearby fishermen islets exudes from these stories, which often run similar one after another.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Endurance, Shackleton&#39;s Incredible Voyage</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage/</guid>
      <description>Of all the stories of maritime adventures I&amp;rsquo;ve read, that of the Endurance, masterfully told by Alfred Lansing in this book, is the most incredible and shocking. Unbelievable to say, given the premise (a crew of 28 men stranded on the Antarctic pack, camped on floating slabs of ice hundreds of miles from any human settlement, at the gates of the Antarctic winter), but the story does not end in tragedy.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Mathematics is politics</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-mathematics-is-politics/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-mathematics-is-politics/</guid>
      <description>Mathematics as the study of relationships: in this aspect lies the similarity and affinity with politics. And then the need in both cases to proceed with stubbornness and trust, without fearing error which, as in all difficult things, is not only lying in wait but inherent, and often, when it is discovered, it is the stimulus and engine of new successes and goals. Hence the need to respect rules and (not or, mind you) the compelling need for revolutions.</description>

      <title>Book Review: King and Emperor, A New Life of Charlemagne</title>
      <link>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-king-and-emperor-a-new-life-of-charlemagne/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-king-and-emperor-a-new-life-of-charlemagne/</guid>
      <description>In this scholarly biography by Janet L. Nelson, Charlemagne is stripped back from the years of mythologizing and idolizing that have occurred since his death. He is presented as distinctly human, and this book is the first time I have felt I could reasonably understand Charlemagne as the man he was, not the man he has since been painted to be. Moreover, Nelson is excellent in her discussions of Charlemagne&amp;rsquo;s wives and their roles.</description>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-language-of-the-spirit-an-introduction-to-classical-music/</guid>
      <description>In this introduction to classical music, Jan Swafford explains the different musical periods and their differences. Each period has its introductory chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer, Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get into the contemporary era.</description>

      <description>Antoine Roquentin, the protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has been living for three years in Bouville, a fictional French seaport town, researching the life of an 18th-century diplomat. During his previous life around the world, Antoine has seen many places, met many interesting people, done exciting things. For the last three years, however, he&amp;rsquo;s been alone in Bouville. He has no friends and no desire to make some or meet anyone.</description>

      <description>I happened across this book by pure chance. After having ice cream in our favourite place in Milano Marittima, my wife and I visited a small street market with all kinds of booths. Of course, there was a used book stand toward which I immediately gravitated. A quick scan revealed nothing of interest, so I moved along. But Serena, who arrived at the booth moments after I left, knew more. A simple, no-frills, cardboard-covered book which carried a giant PROUD 2BEA FLYER title on the spine caught her attention.</description>

      <description>Some call them homeless. The new nomads refer to themselves as &amp;lsquo;houseless&amp;rsquo;. Many took to the road after their savings were obliterated by the Great Recession. To keep their gas tanks and bellies full, they work long hours at hard, physical jobs. In a time of flat wages and rising housing costs, they have unshackled themselves from rent and mortgages as a way to get by. They are surviving America.</description>

      <title>Book Review. Eight Days in May: The Final Collapse of the Third Reich</title>

      <description>Volker Ullrich&amp;rsquo;s Eight Days in May describes the period from April 30, 1945, the day of Hitler&amp;rsquo;s suicide, to May 8, the day of signing the German capitulation, with significant jumps backwards in time and some hops in the future. We&amp;rsquo;re covering only eight days, and the dictator dies on day one. What essential events might ever have happened in such a short period? Well, many pivotal ones, as this well-researched work shows us.</description>

      <title>Proust&#39;s Madeleine Was Originally a Slice of Toast</title>

      <description>A long-sought first draft of Marcel Proust&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;In Search of Lost Time&amp;rsquo; surfaced a few years ago. Its fascinating story and intriguing news are revealed in a Tablet article titled Proust&amp;rsquo;s Madeleine Was Originally a Slice Toast.
Being the Tablet &amp;ldquo;a daily online magazine of Jewish news, ideas, and culture&amp;rdquo;, it makes sense that a good part of the article focuses on Proust&amp;rsquo;s ambivalence about his Jewishness. Still, there are many other interesting tidbits to be learned.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Power to the Words</title>

      <description>Vera Gheno&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Potere alle Parole&amp;rdquo; (Power to the Words) is an essay on the importance of appropriate use of the (Italian) language, not just in written works but also and predominately in everyday life.
 What would we think of a person who, having a vast wardrobe of beautiful clothes, always wore the same suit out of laziness? These situations appear unlikely; yet, they are examples of the attitude that many have towards their language: they have access to an immense, incalculable patrimony, which out of indolence, or fear, or inexperience, they use partially.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Alpi Ribelli: Storie di montagna, resistenza e utopia</title>

      <guid>https://nicolaiarocci.com/book-review-alpi-ribelli-storie-di-montagna-resistenza-e-utopia/</guid>
      <description>The idea behind this book is fascinating. As the subtitle suggests, the book collects stories of rebel mountaineers of all kinds. Some chose to disobey orders; others built refuges of resistance, outposts of autonomy and laboratories of social innovation.
The collection is rich and varied. We go from the heretics who went with Fra Dolcino to the partisans who stopped the Nazi fascists in the mountains of Cuneo and Belluno, up to the contemporary movements against the high-speed train in the Susa Valley.</description>

      <description>According to a famous and fortunate Homeric expression, words are winged, not so much like birds but rather like arrows, which cut the air quickly to go straight to the target and break through the listener&amp;rsquo;s heart. The Greeks have always known that the word is used to convince and show truth and correctness. But they also know that it has a magical force in it: it can turn into a spell, capable of dominating and dragging the listener&amp;rsquo;s soul; to bewitch like music and to heal like medicine; but, above all, to deceive and mislead.</description>

      <description>Robert Edison Fulton was the first solo round-the-world motorcycle tourer. He made his worldwide trip on a two-cylinder Douglas motorcycle between July 1932 and December 1933, more or less 90 years ago. On his way from London to the colonial Middle East, Fulton crossed Nazi Germany. Some of the countries and places he passed do not exist anymore. Most have changed dramatically; others, not so much. I suspect, for example, that his adventures in Syria, Afghanistan, or at the Indian-Pakistani borders might have been written today.</description>

      <description>It is Super Bowl Sunday in the year 2022. Five people, dinner, an apartment on the east side of Manhattan. The retired physics professor and her husband and her former student waiting for the couple who will join them from what becomes a dramatic flight from Paris. The conversation ranges from a survey telescope in North-central Chile to a favorite brand of bourbon to Einstein’s 1912 Manuscript on the Special Theory of Relativity.</description>

      <title>The Real Book (of Jazz)</title>

      <description>What a fascinating read. It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.
 Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand.</description>

      <description>While reading Erebus, The Story of a Ship, my attention was caught by a brief mention of the Whaleship Essex. Being the sucker that I am for exploration and dramatic adventure stories from the early days, I researched it, only to surface with Nathaniel Philbricks&amp;rsquo; In The Heart of the Sea in my hands.
 In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick.</description>

      <description>I am very ignorant about the Istrian Peninsula&amp;rsquo;s history, a gap I always wanted to fill. After some research, Fulvio Tomizza&amp;rsquo;s book, Materada, surfaced as a good fit to fill this gap. It&amp;rsquo;s a semi-biographic historical novel set in the Istria of the author&amp;rsquo;s youth. Fulvio Tomizza was born in Giurizzani di Materada, Istria, in 1935. He had to go through all the torments caused in that disputed area by Fascism first (forced Italianization, cultural suppression), and then by the Second World War and the terrible events that followed: the Foibe massacres and the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus.</description>

      <description>The Literary Hub has a great short interview with Ian McEwan.
 What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received? When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s, I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work. Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor.</description>

      <description>As any other bookworm worth its salt, I digested a generous amount of books on books and the history of libraries. Alberto Manguel&amp;rsquo;s The Library at Night was last, and that is a pity. It probably arrived just a little too late on my shelves. I wish I found it at the beginning of my reading journey when my enthusiasm for libraries and their contents was pristine.
Manguel&amp;rsquo;s writing is mesmerizing and capable.</description>

      <description>I came back to reading Shirley Jackson almost by coincidence. I had just finished watching The Haunting of Hill House, and, as I always do with stuff that tickles my curiosity, I was doing a little research on it. That&amp;rsquo;s how I learned that the TV Series is loosely based on a novel by the same name written by&amp;hellip; Shirley Jackson.
Still imbued by the TV Series&amp;rsquo;s atmospheres, now knowing about its connection with Jackson, I was ready for another dive into her literature of psychological suspense and terror.</description>

      <description>The Water Dancer is the debut novel for Ta-Nehisi Coates, an author and journalist best known for his nonfiction works. Set in a slave plantation located in pre-civil war Virginia, this is a bold and ambitious story about slavery. From the editor website:

      <description>I finished reading Erebus: The Story of a Ship by Michael Palin, an excellent book on the dramatic adventures of the HMS Erebus with her sister ship, the HMS Terror, first in James Clark Ross&amp;rsquo;s Antarctic expedition of 1839-43, and then during Franklin’s ill-fated Arctic expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. I knew Michael Palin as a member of the Monty Python comedy group. As it turns out, since 1980, he has also made many travel documentaries and books.</description>

      <description>Here are five books I read in 2020 that I would recommend. I read several fine books last year, so please check out my reading history if you are unsatisfied with this selection.
Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese, by Patrick Leigh Fermor. I love Patrick Leigh Fermor. Over the years, I read almost everything he wrote. He has been described as &amp;ldquo;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Graham Greene,&amp;rdquo; and for a good reason.</description>
