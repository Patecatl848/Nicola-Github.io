      <description>No matter how long I&amp;rsquo;ve possessed a Mac and how hard I try, there will always be a helpful keyboard shortcut hidden somewhere that I don&amp;rsquo;t know about.
Today I learned about holding the Option key while clicking on the Copy command in Finder. It activates the super-useful (and super-secret) &amp;ldquo;copy as pathname&amp;rdquo; feature.
I spotted this trick on Jamie Smith&amp;rsquo;s website, where other handy shortcuts (and the pretty gif above) reside.</description>

      <description>Pardon me while I&amp;rsquo;m venting out my frustration. I am so tired of Homebrew messing up with my stuff. It used to be the perfect tool for the right job until they decided to auto-brew-update-and-cleanup at every new install. Another day another issue, today with vim not running anymore:
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/lua/lib/liblua.5.3.dylib Referenced from: /user/local/bin/vi Reason: image not found  Lua has suddenly gone missing. Ah, but of course.</description>

      <description>I never see my macOS desktop. It&amp;rsquo;s always cluttered with way too many open windows. When I spot those fantastic, tidy and clean Desktops on the internet, I envy their owners. I wonder if and how they manage to keep those desktops tidy like that the whole workday. It must feel so good.
I try to keep my windows well arranged. The typical setup might be two windows, from two different apps, tiled side by side.</description>

      <title>Battling with SSH, cron jobs, and macOS Keyring</title>

      <description>So today, I was setting up a cronjob on my trusty MacBook Pro. The goal was to backup some folders from a remote Linux server via rsync. The script is simple. It goes something like this:
rsync -avz -e &amp;quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_rsa_keyfile&amp;quot; myuser@myserver:remotedir/ ~/localdir/  Launched by hand, it works seamlessly. Call it from a cron job via crontab, and I get a permission denied error. I then enabled ssh -v option to gather a little intel on what was actually going on.</description>
