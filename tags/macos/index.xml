      <description>I never see my macOS desktop. It&amp;rsquo;s always cluttered with way too many open windows. When I spot those fantastic, tidy and clean Desktops on the internet, I envy their owners. I wonder if and how they manage to keep those desktops tidy like that the whole workday. It must feel so good.
I try to keep my windows well arranged. The typical setup might be two windows, from two different apps, tiled side by side.</description>

      <description>So today, I was setting up a cronjob on my trusty MacBook Pro. The goal was to backup some folders from a remote Linux server via rsync. The script is simple. It goes something like this:
rsync -avz -e &amp;quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_rsa_keyfile&amp;quot; myuser@myserver:remotedir/ ~/localdir/  Launched by hand, it works seamlessly. Call it from a cron job via crontab, and I get a permission denied error. I then enabled ssh -v option to gather a little intel on what was actually going on.</description>
