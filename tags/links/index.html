            <p>Quoting Nelson&rsquo;s weblog:
 Goodreads lost my entire account last week. Nine years as a user, some 600 books and 250 carefully written reviews all deleted and unrecoverable. Their support has not been helpful. In 35 years of being online I&rsquo;ve never encountered a company with such callous disregard for their users&rsquo; data.
 Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:
 My plan now is to host my own blog-like collection of all my reading notes like Tom does. <a class="read-more" href="/trusting-third-party-services-with-your-data-a-cautionary-tale/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.
 I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster&rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&rsquo;re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&rsquo;s length from the actual language. <a class="read-more" href="/youre-probably-using-the-wrong-dictionary/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Chelsea Wald in Nature:
 Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes. According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’). <a class="read-more" href="/how-recycling-pee-could-help-save-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Reddit is currently the most popular search engine. The only people who don’t know that are the team at Reddit, who can’t be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word “reddit” to the end of our queries. [&hellip;] Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying.

We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was cheerfully indifferent to us.

            <p>I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data, old songs now represent 70% of the US music market. Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news gets worse.
 I can&rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&rsquo;s latest piece on recent music trends is super-interesting. <a class="read-more" href="/is-old-music-killing-new-music/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s now old news that the James Webb Telescope was successfully launched on Christmas Day. But last Saturday marked another historic moment for this incredible human artifact:
 After a quarter-century of effort by tens of thousands of people, more than $10 billion in taxpayer funding, and some 350 deployment mechanisms that had to go just so, the James Webb Space Telescope fully unfurled its wings. The massive spacecraft completed its final deployments, and, by God, the process went smoothly. <a class="read-more" href="/go-james-webb/">&raquo;</a></p>

In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it mildly, fascinating.
Some of his insights on technology are also interesting. <a class="read-more" href="/moxie-on-web3/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities that SpaceX&rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no later than this year or the next. In his Science Upside for Starship, the exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of reasonable use-cases for the vessel.
 I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances. <a class="read-more" href="/on-the-incredible-opportunities-offered-by-starship/">&raquo;</a></p>
