            <p>One of my recent discoveries is A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry, by Bret Devereaux, an ancient historian who&rsquo;s been posting great content over the years. His Fireside Fridays, for example, provide intriguing musings on varied topics. In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&rsquo;s perspective.
 Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states. <a class="read-more" href="/a-historian-perspective-on-blockchain-technology/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A very touching Akhil Sharma in The New Yorker:
 Not long after we began dating, my now wife, Christine, and I started making up stories about the child we might have.
We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was cheerfully indifferent to us. He did not wish to be either Irish (like Christine) or Indian (like me). <a class="read-more" href="/a-passage-to-parenthood/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data, old songs now represent 70% of the US music market. Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news gets worse.
 I can&rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&rsquo;s latest piece on recent music trends is super-interesting. <a class="read-more" href="/is-old-music-killing-new-music/">&raquo;</a></p>

 After a quarter-century of effort by tens of thousands of people, more than $10 billion in taxpayer funding, and some 350 deployment mechanisms that had to go just so, the James Webb Space Telescope fully unfurled its wings.

In an attempt to learn more about the so-called Web3 and the technologies around it, he went all-in and built a couple of dApps himself. Then, he produced an NFT and put it up for sale. What he found is, well, to put it mildly, fascinating.

            <p>I found a Consider the Lobster review on Goodreads that almost precisely matches my thoughts on DFW and the book. Hence, given the lazy Christmas-break mood I am in right now, I am conceding myself the right to copy-paste and edit David&rsquo;s review right away.
I know of nobody else who writes as thoughtfully and intelligently as DFW. That he manages to write so informatively, with humor and genuine wit, on almost any subject under the sun is mind-blowing – it&rsquo;s also why I am willing to forgive his occasional stylistic excesses. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-consider-the-lobster/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>When The Digital Antiquarian released his System Shock retrospective earlier this year, I was in awe. System Shock was one of my favorite games back in the day, and yes, in the quarrel between id Software&rsquo;s DOOM and Looking Glass&rsquo;s System Shock, I was siding with the latter. I was so much more for immersion and storyline than shoot &lsquo;em-ups. The Antiquarian article is excellent. If you&rsquo;re into gaming history or, really, into computer&rsquo;s history, I urge you to read it all. <a class="read-more" href="/system-shock-is-back-home/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m not a regular philosophy reader, much less of self-improvement guides. I&rsquo;m wary of the latter and too ignorant for the former. Yet, theologian Vito Mancuso has intrigued me for some time. I followed his podcast on the &ldquo;Four Masters of Life&rdquo;1 and found it excellent. In it, Mancuso discusses his four tutelary deities: &ldquo;Socrates, the educator. Buddha, the physician. Confucius, the politician. Jesus, the prophet.&rdquo; I also listened to some TV interviews where I always found him fascinating. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-about-the-meaning-of-life/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>This weekend assignment was to upgrade a couple of old Windows 10 VMs to Windows 11 in Parallels Desktop 17. I couldn&rsquo;t do that right away because Windows Update was complaining about the lack of the TPM chip. A little research revealed that TPM chips only work on UEFI BIOS. To check which BIOS version was being used in my VMs, I used the msinfo32 (System Information) application. It showed the BIOS to be of &ldquo;Legacy&rdquo; type. <a class="read-more" href="/migrating-a-windows-10-vm-to-windows-11-in-parallels-desktop-a-story-of-tpm-chips-and-bios-upgrades/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities that SpaceX&rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no later than this year or the next. In his Science Upside for Starship, the exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of reasonable use-cases for the vessel.
 I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances. <a class="read-more" href="/on-the-incredible-opportunities-offered-by-starship/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Sait Faik Abasıyanık is an acclaimed Turkish storyteller. A useless man is a collection of short stories that spans nearly two decades of the author&rsquo;s output, offering a glimpse into his imaginative and troubled mind. His overflowing love for others (even sensual, with a preference for street kids) combined with a &ldquo;mal de vivre&rdquo; that pushes him towards self-destruction are apparent.
His passion for the most popular areas of Istanbul and, in contrast, the atavistic nostalgia for the simple life of the nearby fishermen islets exudes from these stories, which often run similar one after another. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-a-useless-man/">&raquo;</a></p>

In Born to be cool, Matthew Duffus writes about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, reporting about his troubled life, musical prowess, influence, and legacy. Some facts are well known, like the reception and then the competition with trumpet legends such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; other tidbits are less known (to me at least).
