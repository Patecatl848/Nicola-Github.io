    <section class="post-content">
      <p>The Water Dancer is the debut novel for Ta-Nehisi Coates, an author and
journalist best known for his nonfiction works. Set in a slave plantation
located in pre-civil war Virginia, this is a bold and ambitious story about
slavery. From the editor <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/550171/the-water-dancer-by-ta-nehisi-coates/">website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away,
Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power.
Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his
life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme:
to escape from the only home he’s ever known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/water_dancer_cover.jpg#right" alt="The Water Dancer, book cover" />
Given the premise, one might expect an action-packed escape story. Instead, the
rhythm is deliberately slow-paced, and the tone is quiet. In fact, some
reviewers find the book a little slow. I disagree. It&rsquo;s calm, yes, but
definitely not slow. Hiram Walker, the main character, has this quiet attitude.
Because he is the narrator, we see the world from his own perspective.</p>

<p>Coates prose is excellent if sometimes a little meandering. Several times while
reading, I was brought back to scenes from Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s Django
Unchained. Mind you, this novel is nothing at all like Django. There is
violence, and brutality too, but they stay under trace. Yet, somehow this novel
manages to validate the movie&rsquo;s events; it makes them very believable.</p>

<p>I was a little disconcerted when supernatural elements started pouring into the
story. The plot deviating from the historic genre into what, fantasy? Then it
landed on me. This work is obviously the result of long and passionate
research. If fantastical elements are introduced, it must be because they fit
with the story somehow. A little research reveals that, indeed, that is the
case. Myths of slaves escaping their condition by magic means or powerful
ritual songs were deep-rooted within their culture. In this novel, legend
becomes reality. What I initially found to be jarring turns out to be the
perfect plot-twist, the expedient that allows the story to unfold.</p>

<p>The Underground Railroad, the network of secret routes and safe houses used by
the enslaved to escape into the free states of the North, is a fascinating
subject. I did not know about it, and I am grateful to this book for teaching
me.</p>

<p>I think this book does an excellent job at recounting slavery from the enslaved
(or the Tasked, as the author calls them) viewpoint and their culture.</p>
