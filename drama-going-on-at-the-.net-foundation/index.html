    <section class="post-content">
      <p>A few months after I released my first <a href="https://fatturaelettronicaopensource.org/">.NET open source project</a> (a niche
one targeting the Italian fintech world), I was contacted by a representative
of Team Digitale, the digital innovation branch of the Italian Public
Administration. He suggested joining the Developers Italia initiative and
moving my project to the their organization on GitHub &ldquo;to enjoy
enhanced visibility and broaden the audience&rdquo;. I politely refused. I did not
doubt my counterpart&rsquo;s good faith. At the same time, I was concerned about the
possible long-term consequences of a seemingly easy move. Moving a GitHub
project away from your profile or an organization you control means ceding
control over it. I was assured I would keep control of the project. But what
happens if sometime in the future, when people in charge might even have
changed, they revoke my access rights? As long as I am involved with my
project, I should be in control. Also, I was not convinced that the move would
help promote the project. We live in the search-engine age; people search for
solutions to their problems. I was, and still am, confident that if I did my
due diligence and my project is any good, people will find it<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario pictured above, or worse, appears to
be happening these days, not to me, but to the many open-source maintainers
who, in recent years, agreed to move their projects under the .NET Foundation
umbrella.  The drama is unfolding in these very same hours, and it is
painful. On my Twitter feed, I first noticed <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_sink/status/1445096990153613323">Eric Sink&rsquo;s note</a> on the issue.
The next day, a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/05/microsoft_net_foundation_under_fire/">detailed article</a> surfaces on The Register. Then, just
yesterday, the Executive Director of the DNF posted an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39">I am Sorry</a> message on
GitHub, which most maintainers consider disappointing, to say the least.
Maintainers see the ownership of their projects being moved over to DNF. Some
projects are transferred to GitHub Enterprise for no apparent reason. DNF
Executive Director opened a Pull Request, which was closed by the maintainers
and then reopened (twice!) by the Director (who also happens to be a former
maintainer). You can get all the details at the links above. The I am Sorry
thread is especially worth reading.</p>

<p>I think the foundation is well-intentioned. I question whether independent
open-source projects should belong there, though—maybe very few major and
commercially inclined ones. To offer legal protection, DNF needs some control
over its projects, and that&rsquo;s something not every maintainer is willing to give
away. On the other hand, Maintainers might have underestimated the consequences
of moving their projects to DNF. I can feel their pain.</p>

<p>Overall, this is all concerning. As someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28759630">commented</a> on Hacker News, with the
.NET ecosystem, Microsoft has made so many surprisingly good moves in recent
years that there is room for a couple of fuck-ups, but this is a big one.
Besides, most maintainers involved in this drama are highly influential and
very well respected individuals in the .NET world. The DNF needs to get its
acts together and react immediately, at the risk of losing all its credibility.</p>

<li id="fn:6">One year later, someone from the same team got in touch and proposed the move again. I refused for the same reasons. The story is actually longer than that. A few months later, I was also invited to join Team Digitale. I even had a brief video call with their recruiter. I chukled when he realized I was a grey beard, not the typical just-out-of-college boy or girl they usually head-hunt.
