            <p>If you understand Italian, the recording of my Playwright session at UGIdotNET&rsquo;s WebDay 2022 is now available on YouTube1. Playwright is a phenomenal cross-browser, cross-platform, cross-language, single-API, mobile-friendly front-end testing tool.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to giving the same session in English sooner or later, but I should first win my laziness and start looking for exciting events with open CFPs.

            <p>Dan Goodin at Ars Tecnica, on multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA):
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a core defense that is among the most effective at preventing account takeovers. In addition to requiring that users provide a username and password, MFA ensures they must also use an additional factor—be it a fingerprint, physical security key, or one-time password—before they can access an account. Nothing in this article should be construed as saying MFA isn’t anything other than essential. <a class="read-more" href="/how-multifactor-authentication-is-breached/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A few weeks ago, Giulia turned eighteen. As a birthday gift, she asked for a skiing weekend with me. Our family&rsquo;s precious little thing has traditionally been spending the Christmas week skiing in the Alps. We haven&rsquo;t gone as much as we&rsquo;d like in recent years, so I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled that she wanted to celebrate adulthood at our special place with her dad.
We left home Friday at five in the morning. <a class="read-more" href="/three-days-well-spent/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A few months ago I started my review of Lansing&rsquo;s Endurance: Shackleton&rsquo;s Incredible Voyage with these words:
 Of all the stories of maritime adventures I’ve read, that of the Endurance, masterfully told by Alfred Lansing in this book, is the most incredible and shocking.
 And I meant that. As the book&rsquo;s title suggests, that story is simply unbelievable, yet true. Imagine my astonishment this morning at the news that the Endurance was found in the depths of the Antarctic. <a class="read-more" href="/endurance-shackletons-lost-ship-found-in-antarctic/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Quoting Nelson&rsquo;s weblog:
 Goodreads lost my entire account last week. Nine years as a user, some 600 books and 250 carefully written reviews all deleted and unrecoverable. Their support has not been helpful. In 35 years of being online I&rsquo;ve never encountered a company with such callous disregard for their users&rsquo; data.
 Ouch. A lesson learned the hard way:

            <p>This book stands up to its fame. It&rsquo;s chock-full of precious insights on our decision-making and behavioral processes and how and why we humans are often capable of making informed yet awful decisions. The bad news is that we can hardly avoid most of these biases, no matter how hard we try and even if we know about them. So-called experts in the field are subject to these same biases: their short-term estimates and predictions can even be pretty good, but they will fail miserably in the long term, like any other man or woman. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-thinking-fast-and-slow/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.
 I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster&rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&rsquo;re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&rsquo;s length from the actual language. <a class="read-more" href="/youre-probably-using-the-wrong-dictionary/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The story of Ukraine&rsquo;s flag is rich and controversial. It appears to be true, however, that &ldquo;blue sky over sunflowers&rdquo; forms Ukrainians&rsquo; conception of their flag. <a class="read-more" href="/what-ukraine-flag-signifies/">&raquo;</a></p>

I dig the new List patterns and am a fan of allowing newlines in the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; of interpolated strings.

            <p>This book is not about the famous, daring, and in some ways fortunate capture of Eichmann in Buenos Aires in 1960, nor about the covert transfer of the Nazi officer to Israel. Instead, the volume recounts the 1961 trial in Jerusalem, which ended with the defendant being sentenced to death. Hannah Arendt followed the trial as a correspondent for The New Yorker. She took notes, studied the papers, and reconstructed the many witnesses&rsquo; personal stories. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-eichmann-in-jerusalem.-a-report-on-the-banality-of-evil/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Chelsea Wald in Nature:
 Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes. According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’). <a class="read-more" href="/how-recycling-pee-could-help-save-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

Harald is mainly known for introducing Christianity to Denmark and consolidating his rule over most Jutland and Zealand. However, what sparked my interest is that Harald was nicknamed &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo;, and, in 1997, the Bluetooth wireless specification design was named after him. <a class="read-more" href="/the-curious-origins-of-bluetooths-name/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;re releasing a major project on which we&rsquo;ve been working non-stop for two and a half years. No matter how many years in the trenches, release day always makes me a bit nervous. Experience does help. I know there will be problems, and we will solve them. Some customers will complain, and those will be the most vocal. The vast majority of them will appreciate the effort, enjoy the features, and stay silent. <a class="read-more" href="/lay-back-and-keep-smiling/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I had a hunch that old songs were taking over music streaming platforms—but even I was shocked when I saw the most recent numbers. According to MRC Data, old songs now represent 70% of the US music market. Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news gets worse.
 I can&rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&rsquo;s latest piece on recent music trends is super-interesting. <a class="read-more" href="/is-old-music-killing-new-music/">&raquo;</a></p>
