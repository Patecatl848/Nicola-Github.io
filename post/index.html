            <p>My brilliant friend Salvatore Sanfilippo (otherwise known as antirez of Redis fame) has an interesting write-up on his website. How similar is programming to prose writing? After getting his own feet wet with novel writing, he is convinced that the two activities share many common traits.
 One year ago I paused my programming life and started writing a novel, with the illusion that my new activity was deeply different than the previous one. <a class="read-more" href="/on-programming-and-writing/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>According to a famous and fortunate Homeric expression, words are winged, not so much like birds but rather like arrows, which cut the air quickly to go straight to the target and break through the listener&rsquo;s heart. The Greeks have always known that the word is used to convince and show truth and correctness. But they also know that it has a magical force in it: it can turn into a spell, capable of dominating and dragging the listener&rsquo;s soul; to bewitch like music and to heal like medicine; but, above all, to deceive and mislead. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-the-voice-of-the-sirens.-the-greeks-and-the-art-of-persuasion/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Flask 2.0 has just been released. Along with it come many other major satellite releases: Werkzeug 2.0, Jinja 3.0, Click 8.0, ItsDangerous 2.0, and MarkupSafe 2.0.
Across all projects, Python 3.6+ is now required, and comprehensive type annotations are supported. At a glance, I&rsquo;d say that the biggest news is async views in Flask 2. Work has also been done around Werkzeug Request and Response classes to allow for better sync and async in the future (it&rsquo;s not a public API yet. <a class="read-more" href="/flask-2.0/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>For decades Scandinavian countries have been renowned for their educational systems, low levels of corruption, sustainable economy, social justice, overall quality of life. According to Jukka Savolainen on Slate, the reason why Finns have now been dominating the World Happiness Report four years in a row has little to do with these factors and more with their life expectations.
Savolainen perspective is interesting because he is a Finn living in the US. <a class="read-more" href="/the-grim-secret-of-nordic-happiness/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I am very late to the party, but today I learned that the good old dotnet SmptClient is considered obsolete and should not be used. Quoting the documentation:
 We don&rsquo;t recommend using the SmtpClient class for new development because SmtpClient doesn&rsquo;t support many modern protocols. Use MailKit or other libraries instead. (source)
 Interestingly, Microsoft is recommending a third-party open-source library as an alternative. I hope we&rsquo;ll see more of that in the future. <a class="read-more" href="/dotnet-smtpclient-should-not-be-used/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Robert Edison Fulton was the first solo round-the-world motorcycle tourer. He made his worldwide trip on a two-cylinder Douglas motorcycle between July 1932 and December 1933, more or less 90 years ago. On his way from London to the colonial Middle East, Fulton crossed Nazi Germany. Some of the countries and places he passed do not exist anymore. Most have changed dramatically; others, not so much. I suspect, for example, that his adventures in Syria, Afghanistan, or at the Indian-Pakistani borders might have been written today. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-one-man-caravan/">&raquo;</a></p>

 You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and demands that you fix something immediately. You might typically use git-stash1 to store your changes away temporarily. However, your working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&rsquo;t want to risk disturbing any of it. <a class="read-more" href="/git-worktree-vs-git-savepoints/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s maintenance day in my little Python world. I just released new versions of two small but apparently quite popular packages:
 eve-swagger, the OpenAPI/Swager extensions for Eve-powered APIs, hits v0.1.4. It&rsquo;s just a single fix for API breakage introduced with the previous release; details available here. Thanks to Asger Gitz-Johansen for the help with this release.
 Flask-Sentinel, an Oauth2 Provider for Flask, hits v0.0.8. This also is a small release that fixes 500 errors if you were using unpinned versions of redis. <a class="read-more" href="/new-eve-swagger-and-flask-sentinel-releases/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As I was browsing my RSS feed this morning, I came across a new blog from Nat Friedman over at GitHub. The piece was titled &ldquo;Open source goes to Mars&rdquo;, and, of course, it caught my interest. In the article, Nat announced a Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission badge added to GitHub profiles contributing to open-source projects and libraries used by Ingenuity. Some time ago, like many others, I was granted the Arctic Code Vault badge, so I am familiar with the concept. <a class="read-more" href="/i-am-a-mars-helicopter-contributor/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Yeah. This article resonates with me. SQLite is the de-facto standard engine for embedded systems.

            <p>What a fascinating read. It sits right at the intersection of two of my (too many) vicious interests: Jazz music and books.
 Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand. <a class="read-more" href="/the-real-book-of-jazz/">&raquo;</a></p>

 In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-the-tragedy-of-the-waleship-essex/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This is a maintained technical guide that aims to provide introduction to various online tracking techniques, online id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining (truly) anonymous online identities including social media accounts safely and legally. No pre-requisites besides English reading are required.
 At a glance, I suspect most people will be tempted to dismiss The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Online Anonymity as borderline paranoia. But make no mistake, it is a great resource. <a class="read-more" href="/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-online-anonymity/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Phil and Jeremy both turned 50 this year. They took the opportunity to write some half-century notes. Having turned 50 myself and inspired by them, I thought I would do the same.
0-10 I see the light 50 years ago in Molise, a southern region of Italy that also happens to be the smallest and less known. One year later, my brother joins the family. Our parents are from a small village in Molise heights. <a class="read-more" href="/half-century-of-service/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>When we talk about getting better at programming, we often talk about testing, writing reusable code, design patterns, and readability. All of those things are important. But in this blog post, I want to talk about a different way to get better at programming: learning how the systems you’re using work! This is the main way I approach getting better at programming.
