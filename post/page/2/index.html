            <p>This book stands up to its fame. It&rsquo;s chock-full of precious insights on our decision-making and behavioral processes and how and why we humans are often capable of making informed yet awful decisions. The bad news is that we can hardly avoid most of these biases, no matter how hard we try and even if we know about them. So-called experts in the field are subject to these same biases: their short-term estimates and predictions can even be pretty good, but they will fail miserably in the long term, like any other man or woman. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-thinking-fast-and-slow/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In 2014, James Somers sat down to write a beautiful, entertaining lament about the state of today’s dictionaries and an argument in favor of the adoption of Noah Webster’s 1913 edition.
 I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that it&rsquo;s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster&rsquo;s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. They&rsquo;re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm&rsquo;s length from the actual language. <a class="read-more" href="/youre-probably-using-the-wrong-dictionary/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The story of Ukraine&rsquo;s flag is rich and controversial. It appears to be true, however, that &ldquo;blue sky over sunflowers&rdquo; forms Ukrainians&rsquo; conception of their flag. <a class="read-more" href="/what-ukraine-flag-signifies/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The first preview of C# 11 is out, and well, I think I like what I see. I dig the new List patterns and am a fan of allowing newlines in the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; of interpolated strings. Parameter null-checking is a bit contentious, and it&rsquo;s good that they are releasing it in preview one and asking for feedback.
In a nutshell, they want to spare us a lot of boilerplate. Code like this: <a class="read-more" href="/paramter-null-checking-added-to-csharp-11-preview/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Chelsea Wald in Nature:
 Scientists say that urine diversion would have huge environmental and public-health benefits if deployed on a large scale around the world. That’s in part because urine is rich in nutrients that, instead of polluting water bodies, could go towards fertilizing crops or feed into industrial processes. According to Simha’s estimates, humans produce enough urine to replace about one-quarter of current nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers worldwide; it also contains potassium and many micronutrients (see ‘What’s in urine’). <a class="read-more" href="/how-recycling-pee-could-help-save-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Reddit is currently the most popular search engine. The only people who don’t know that are the team at Reddit, who can’t be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word “reddit” to the end of our queries. [&hellip;] Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust. <a class="read-more" href="/google-search-is-dying/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been back at the forge working on Eve 2.0. Version 2 will support Python 3.7+ and drop Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6. It will bring support for PyMongo 4+ as well, along with several other minor fixes and improvements (changelog). It would be nice if you guys and gals, users of Eve, would give it a spin before the release.

            <p>When Giulia came home from school today, she was anxious to tell me what she learned about a Viking King and his legacy. She told me the story of King Harald Gormsson, who ruled Denmark and Norway from c. 958 to c. 986. Harald is mainly known for introducing Christianity to Denmark and consolidating his rule over most Jutland and Zealand. However, what sparked my interest is that Harald was nicknamed &ldquo;Bluetooth&rdquo;, and, in 1997, the Bluetooth wireless specification design was named after him. <a class="read-more" href="/the-curious-origins-of-bluetooths-name/">&raquo;</a></p>

In this week instalment, professor Devereaux takes on the different applications of blockchain technology as seen from a historian&rsquo;s perspective.
 Really, this is less about the technologies themselves and more about the nature of states. <a class="read-more" href="/a-historian-perspective-on-blockchain-technology/">&raquo;</a></p>

We named the child—or, in the stories we told about him, he named himself—Suzuki Noguchi. Among the things we liked about him was that he was cheerfully indifferent to us.

Those who make a living from new music—especially that endangered species known as the working musician—have to look at these figures with fear and trembling. But the news gets worse.
 I can&rsquo;t say I can relate as my kids of ages 21, 18, and 16 do their best to stay clear from the music I like, but anyways, Ted Gioia&rsquo;s latest piece on recent music trends is super-interesting. <a class="read-more" href="/is-old-music-killing-new-music/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Over the years, Iperborea, one of my favorite Italian publishers, has been publishing an unofficial Nordic Tales series. Their renowned nordic fiction series includes one fairy tale volume per year, usually published in December, just for Christmas. The first book was Lapland Tales in 2014, and then they continued with Danish, Icelandic, Swedish, Faroe, Norwegian, Greenlandic and then Finnish in 2021. I&rsquo;ve been greedily reading each one of them, usually as my last book of the year. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-finnish-fairy-tales/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This year I&rsquo;ve read twenty-one books or 5903 pages. That&rsquo;s fewer books than last year (28 / 8064), the year before (25 / 8394), and the one before that (30 / 8447). Heck, I must look back at 2014 to score a win in my very own yearly reading challenge. What surprises me is not much the number of books but the pages I read, which constitutes a more relevant metric. <a class="read-more" href="/three-good-books-i-read-in-2021/">&raquo;</a></p>
