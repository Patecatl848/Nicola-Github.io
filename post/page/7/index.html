            <p>Ever had your old, trusty Python virtual environment fail on you? I sure did. Sometimes, when I activate or switch between virtual environments, I get the following error:
$ workon eve dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../.Python  I never really took the time to look into it. When this happens, because I am in a rush (and because I am a lazy old fart), I shrug it off, recreate the virtual environment on the spot, and get back to work. <a class="read-more" href="/when-homebrew-breaks-your-python-virtual-environment/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Water Dancer is the debut novel for Ta-Nehisi Coates, an author and journalist best known for his nonfiction works. Set in a slave plantation located in pre-civil war Virginia, this is a bold and ambitious story about slavery. From the editor website:
 Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-the-water-dancer/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>After six years in the field, Chris has shared his strong opinions on software development practices, languages, and methodologies. I like his attitude. Willingness to continuously put one&rsquo;s personal views under scrutiny, eventually adapting or even changing them as needed, is not a common trait. Not in our field. While I generally agree with most of his opinions, I feel the urge to comment on a few of them.

            <p>As a non-native English reader, I had to look up the true meaning of &ldquo;Unbundling&rdquo; as a neologism. According to Wikipedia
 Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices, Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions (education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by &ldquo;break[ing] up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old order. <a class="read-more" href="/the-great-unbundling-according-to-benedict-evans/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I am presenting at two different events in February next month. Given the current COVID situation, that is entirely unexpected. In 2020 I only gave four talks, three of which were virtual. I am not holding my breath for 2021. Conferences are going virtual all year-long. Next year too, most likely.
There are some clear advantages in going virtual, but the final result is a net negative.

            <p>We&rsquo;ve seen other articles pointing the finger at unnecessarily bloated websites. Terence Eden&rsquo;s On the unreasonable effectiveness of simple HTML deserves mention, I think, for two reasons. First, the delivery is incredibly effective. Second, it is effective because of the storytelling.
By enveloping the message into an original short, touching story, he achieves two goals. First, he captures the reader&rsquo;s attention; second, he makes the experience memorable. Please, go and read it; I&rsquo;ll wait here. <a class="read-more" href="/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-simple-html/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I finished reading Erebus: The Story of a Ship by Michael Palin, an excellent book on the dramatic adventures of the HMS Erebus with her sister ship, the HMS Terror, first in James Clark Ross&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition of 1839-43, and then during Franklin’s ill-fated Arctic expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. I knew Michael Palin as a member of the Monty Python comedy group. As it turns out, since 1980, he has also made many travel documentaries and books. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-erebus-the-story-of-a-ship/">&raquo;</a></p>

Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese, by Patrick Leigh Fermor. I love Patrick Leigh Fermor. Over the years, I read almost everything he wrote. He has been described as &ldquo;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond, and Graham Greene,&rdquo; and for a good reason. <a class="read-more" href="/five-good-books-i-read-in-2020/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Today I was happily migrating some C# projects to Net 5 when I stumbled upon something unexpected. My focus was on a library (a NetStandard2.0 REST API client, an SDK) and its associated test suite. The test project was a NetCore 3.1 application.
As you can imagine, being a REST API client, the library does a lot of talking with a remote Web Service. It does that by leveraging the almightly System. <a class="read-more" href="/httpresponsemessage.content-is-non-nullable-in-net5/">&raquo;</a></p>

He is super active in the Python space, so much that he received the Python Software Foundation Fellow Membership back in 2018.

 Remember, the inability to see and hear your audience is disconcerting but it doesn’t mean you should give up. There are much bigger audiences in the wide world that you will not have local access to. <a class="read-more" href="/how-to-present-over-video-conference/">&raquo;</a></p>
