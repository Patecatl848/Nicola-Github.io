            <p>Space-junkie me is back, this time reading about the innumerable opportunities that SpaceX&rsquo;s Starship will offer once it becomes operational, hopefully no later than this year or the next. In his Science Upside for Starship, the exceptionally knowledgeable Casey Handmer makes a case for Starship relevance in the future of space exploration by listing an astounding number of reasonable use-cases for the vessel.
 I think it is relatively straightforward to think of cool things to do with SpaceX Starships, so recent posts have focused on trying to understand the more mixed consequences for incumbent industrial organizations that are not ideally positioned to exploit the coming advances. <a class="read-more" href="/on-the-incredible-opportunities-offered-by-starship/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Sait Faik Abasıyanık is an acclaimed Turkish storyteller. A useless man is a collection of short stories that spans nearly two decades of the author&rsquo;s output, offering a glimpse into his imaginative and troubled mind. His overflowing love for others (even sensual, with a preference for street kids) combined with a &ldquo;mal de vivre&rdquo; that pushes him towards self-destruction are apparent.
His passion for the most popular areas of Istanbul and, in contrast, the atavistic nostalgia for the simple life of the nearby fishermen islets exudes from these stories, which often run similar one after another. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-a-useless-man/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A great piece of writing on jazz has recently been posted on The Smart Set. In Born to be cool, Matthew Duffus writes about jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, reporting about his troubled life, musical prowess, influence, and legacy. Some facts are well known, like the reception and then the competition with trumpet legends such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; other tidbits are less known (to me at least).

            <p>Of all the stories of maritime adventures I&rsquo;ve read, that of the Endurance, masterfully told by Alfred Lansing in this book, is the most incredible and shocking. Unbelievable to say, given the premise (a crew of 28 men stranded on the Antarctic pack, camped on floating slabs of ice hundreds of miles from any human settlement, at the gates of the Antarctic winter), but the story does not end in tragedy. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-endurance-shackletons-incredible-voyage/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Mathematics as the study of relationships: in this aspect lies the similarity and affinity with politics. And then the need in both cases to proceed with stubbornness and trust, without fearing error which, as in all difficult things, is not only lying in wait but inherent, and often, when it is discovered, it is the stimulus and engine of new successes and goals. Hence the need to respect rules and (not or, mind you) the compelling need for revolutions. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-mathematics-is-politics/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We want our test and production stacks to be automatically updated every time something new is pushed to the test or release branch. CI builds the docker image on successful test runs, then stores it in our private registry. But how do you automatically pull and deploy those updated images?
I looked into the Watchtower project, which is interesting. You add Watchtower to the stack, and it will diligently check for new versions of the images used by the containers in the stack, pulling, building and deploying as needed while the stack is up and running. <a class="read-more" href="/how-to-automatically-pull-and-deploy-updated-docker-images/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Flo, our dog, spent her whole fifteen-years long life with us. Many, many times after she passed away, I wondered if she lived a happy dog life or not. In The posthuman dog (Aeon), Jessica Pierce poses a fascinating question that somehow helps find answers to my troubling question:
 If humans were to disappear from the face of the Earth, what might dogs become? And would they be better off without us? <a class="read-more" href="/the-posthuman-dog/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Tonight someone opened a ticket on the Eve repository. I jotted down a quick reply and was about to hit the Comment button when I thought a more articulated reply was in order. I also want it published on my website.
So the question is:
 Is Eve still maintained?
 My reply goes like this:
Hello, yes, Eve is in &lsquo;maintenance mode&rsquo;, as I call it. I don&rsquo;t actively develop new features anymore. <a class="read-more" href="/is-eve-still-maintained/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In this scholarly biography by Janet L. Nelson, Charlemagne is stripped back from the years of mythologizing and idolizing that have occurred since his death. He is presented as distinctly human, and this book is the first time I have felt I could reasonably understand Charlemagne as the man he was, not the man he has since been painted to be. Moreover, Nelson is excellent in her discussions of Charlemagne&rsquo;s wives and their roles. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-king-and-emperor-a-new-life-of-charlemagne/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In this introduction to classical music, Jan Swafford explains the different musical periods and their differences. Each period has its introductory chapter, followed by chapters dedicated to the most influential composers of the era. The choice is comprehensive and well cared for, with the most relevant names well-investigated both in biography and works. For each composer, Swafford also offers some listening suggestions. Biographies thicken as we get into the contemporary era. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-language-of-the-spirit-an-introduction-to-classical-music/">&raquo;</a></p>
