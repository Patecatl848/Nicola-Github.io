            <p>The Literary Hub has a great short interview with Ian McEwan.
 What’s the best writing advice you’ve ever received? When I was living in London at the start of my career in the mid-1970s, I became friends with Philip Roth, who took an avuncular interest in my work. Where many others thought my writing was wild and weird, he thought I wasn’t being wild enough. He once came to my apartment and spread the typescript of my first novel (The Cement Garden) over the floor. <a class="read-more" href="/you-have-to-write-as-though-your-parents-are-dead/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The always brilliant Hynek recently posted Semantic Versioning Will Not Save You. Primarily targeted at consumers of SemVer-versioned packages, it is full of insightful advice.
From my perspective as an open-source maintainer, I can tell you that versioning is hard. Judging when a new release is going to break backward compatibility is not as simple as it might seem on the surface, and Hynek does a great job explaining why. Sometimes it is also hard for me to tell if a change in a codebase classifies as a new feature, small improvement, or fix—subtle differences. <a class="read-more" href="/semantic-versioning-will-not-save-you/">&raquo;</a></p>

As someone who&rsquo;s been fighting the protection/obfuscation cat &amp; mouse game for twenty+ years, let me tell you one thing. The way this guy reverse-engineered parts of the GTA5 codebase and then proceeded to single-handly triage and fix a long-standing (7+ years) performance issue is simply mindblowing. All he had to work with were heavily obfuscated dlls.

            <p>Today, my Sunday long-reading list included New Yorker&rsquo;s The Activists Who Embrace Nuclear Power by Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow. Can nuclear power possibly be a viable solution for climate change? Twenty or even ten years ago, my answer would have been a big fat No. Today? Not so sure anymore.
 Today, the looming disruptions of climate change have altered the risk calculus around nuclear energy. James Hansen, the NASA scientist credited with first bringing global warming to public attention, in 1988, has long advocated a vast expansion of nuclear power to replace fossil fuels. <a class="read-more" href="/the-activists-who-embrace-nuclear-power/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In March 1970, Dr. John Conway sent the &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; (as he later referred to it) letter to Martin Gardner. He was submitting ideas for Gardner&rsquo;s Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.
The New York Times features a good article on the fifty-year parable of The Game of Life. What&rsquo;s appreciable, they asked some of Life&rsquo;s most steadfast friends to reflect upon its influence and lessons over half a century.

I had just finished watching The Haunting of Hill House, and, as I always do with stuff that tickles my curiosity, I was doing a little research on it. That&rsquo;s how I learned that the TV Series is loosely based on a novel by the same name written by&hellip; Shirley Jackson.
Still imbued by the TV Series&rsquo;s atmospheres, now knowing about its connection with Jackson, I was ready for another dive into her literature of psychological suspense and terror. <a class="read-more" href="/book-review-we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Today I learned the hard way: don&rsquo;t you dare running a vanilla install of VirtualBox together with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). It won&rsquo;t work. That&rsquo;s because WSL2 uses Hyper-V under the hood, which is incompatible with VirtualBox.
According to the official documentation for VirtualBox v6.0:
 Oracle VM VirtualBox can be used on a Windows host where Hyper-V is running. This is an experimental feature. No configuration is required. <a class="read-more" href="/troubles-with-virtualbox-and-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Unbundling is a neologism to describe how the ubiquity of mobile devices, Internet connectivity, consumer web technologies, social media and information access in the 21st century is affecting older institutions (education, broadcasting, newspapers, games, shopping, etc.) by &ldquo;break[ing] up the packages they once offered (possibly even for free), providing particular parts of them at a scale and cost unmatchable by the old order. <a class="read-more" href="/the-great-unbundling-according-to-benedict-evans/">&raquo;</a></p>
