    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Antoine Roquentin, the protagonist of the novel, is a former adventurer who has
been living for three years in Bouville, a fictional French seaport town,
researching the life of an 18th-century diplomat. During his previous life
around the world, Antoine has seen many places, met many interesting people,
done exciting things. For the last three years, however, he&rsquo;s been alone in
Bouville. He has no friends and no desire to make some or meet anyone. He&rsquo;s
interested in nothing, not even in his work that he keeps neglecting. His days
are mostly spent walking around town, listening to conversations and observing
people around him. A &ldquo;sweeting sickness&rdquo; he calls nausea increasingly impinges
on almost everything he does and enjoys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something has happened to me, I can&rsquo;t doubt it any more. It came as an
illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything evident. It
came cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little put out,
that&rsquo;s all. Once established it never moved, it stayed quiet, and I was able
to persuade myself that nothing was the matter with me, that it was a false
alarm. And now, it&rsquo;s blossoming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has a relationship with a woman, but it is exclusively carnal: the two
exchange almost no words. Selt-Taught Man, an individual who spends his time at
the local library reading all books in alphabetical order, is one of his few
acquaintances. When Self-Taught Man invites Antoine for lunch, he notes on his
diary: &ldquo;I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself.&rdquo; Antoine
has no interest in relationships. They take too much effort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell a story: the
plausible disappears at the same time as the friends.</p>
</blockquote>

Antoine feels like he never lived but only existed. These days, we would
probably call Antoine&rsquo;s sickness with a different name, depression maybe. If
you ever felt like Antoine, Nausea is going to be a difficult read. If you
didn&rsquo;t, I suspect it will be hard for you to feel any sympathy for the
protagonist. Sartre writes beautifully, with razor-sharp precision. Despite his
attempts to refuse it, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964. Nausea was
Sartre&rsquo;s debut novel, and he always considered it his best fictional work.
Nausea, by Jean-Paul Sartre, is a challenging but rewarding read. I think
Sartre goes straight amongst the masters at describing the human condition.</p>
