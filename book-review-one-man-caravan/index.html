    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Robert Edison Fulton was the first solo round-the-world motorcycle tourer. That
might sound or not sound impressive, but let me add a little more detail so you
can get the whole picture. He made his worldwide trip on a two-cylinder Douglas
motorcycle between July 1932 and December 1933, more or less 90 years ago. On
his way from London to the colonial Middle East, he crossed Nazi Germany. Some
of the countries and places he passed do not exist anymore. Most have changed
dramatically; others, not so much. I suspect his adventures in Syria,
Afghanistan, or at the Indian-Pakistani borders might have been written today.</p>

<p>When Fulton started his journey, he was in his early twenties. The book was
published only a few years later, in 1937. Stories were fresh and unconditioned
by the passing age. That is important because, within the next decade, the
world would change forever. In Japan, he is greeted by a flock of japan
motorcyclists who will accompany him across the country, celebrating the bonds
between the United States and the Rising Sun. A bunch of years later,
a situation like that would have been next to impossible.</p>

<p><img src="/images/one-man-caravan.jpg#right" alt="One Man Caravan book cover" />
This book is not your typical motorcycle log. It is more about stories, people,
and societies. The Author might happily skip thousands of miles across some
incredible terrain and places just because he feels the urge to tell us about
that memorable encounter he had in Teheran or Tokyo or that otherwise small
insignificant Malaysian village.</p>

<p>The tone is often naive and amusing. Even dramatic events are often narrated in
a light, entertaining fashion. But make no mistake, this was a genuine,
dangerous adventure. It is somewhat startling that the Author could cross so
many God-forsaken places only to get his bike stolen when he was back home in
New York. Thankfully, he got it back one week later.</p>

<p>In few occurrences, a seemingly colonial attitude surfaces. That might sound
jarring to the modern educated reader, but we have to put it all in context.
After all, in 1932, Fulton was the offspring of a wealthy American family. He
was studying in London when he replied to a dare and then left to explore the
world. Given the premise, I think he emerges as a curious, unassuming person
who is willing to learn, understand and, of course, explore.</p>

<p>Another young student, Patrick Leight Fermor, travelled across Europe in those
years, but on foot. Leigh memories are also available in a three-book series
for your reading pleasure<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Together, the stories of these two fearless authors
draw a great picture of that age, right before WWII and the following
industrial and technological sprawl, when the world was still enormous and
split into many, often isolated cultures and societies.</p>
