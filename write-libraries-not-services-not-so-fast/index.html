    <section class="post-content">
      <p><a href="http://catern.com/services.html">Write libraries instead of services</a> is an interesting article I read
a while ago. I cannot get it off my head. In an attempt to clear up my mind,
I decided to sit down and write about it. I have been writing libraries for
a good part of my life. Most of my earlier dev-work resides on thousands of
computers in the form of libraries. More recently, I have been writing and
deploying remote services. Libraries versus Services is a topic I care about.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service
provider. A properly designed library instead moves these costs to the users
of the library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ignores the issue of support. You are going to have to support your users.
Support comes at a cost. I would argue that, given the distributed nature of
libraries, supporting them can become <em>very</em> costly. Your library is probably
residing in a myriad of diverse, local environments. Issues are hard to
replicate or reason about. It is hard to isolate your own code from the
surrounding environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People say, &ldquo;services are easy because you can upgrade them centrally, so you
can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone&rsquo;s lives worse.&rdquo; But this
assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone
else. If one user can&rsquo;t have a negative impact on other users, then you don&rsquo;t
care if some users are slow to upgrade; they&rsquo;re only hurting themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, support. Those slow-to-upgrade users are going to not just hurt but
torture your support service with years-old obsolete issues.  If you think it&rsquo;s
the user&rsquo;s responsibility to keep dependencies up to date, good luck with that.
That assumes that developers adopting the library control their deployments,
which isn&rsquo;t often the case. They might employ the library in a desktop
application distributed to dozens (or thousands) of end-users. It could be next
to impossible for them to make sure that all their deployments are up to speed.
Old versions are a pain point and one (if not the most) significant cost
factor. Maintaining a service comes at a cost too, and you&rsquo;ll likely need to
offer some sort of support there as well. A service, however, ensures that all
your users are on the same version, which tremendously reduces the support
effort.</p>

<p>When weighting costs, support must be factored in, along with all the rest:
development, maintenance, distribution, documentation, etc.  Maybe the
article&rsquo;s author has the luxury of not having to deal with support himself.
Still, there&rsquo;s someone else at his company who has to do that.</p>

<p>A service, on the other hand, represents a single point of failure. If it goes
down, all users are immediately affected<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>. By contrast, a nasty bug in your
library will only affect the unlucky users on that version. Now, <em>this</em> makes
a significant advantage for distributed libraries.</p>

<p>Your service, however, will talk to all languages via REST, GraphQL, or any
other interface of choice. The library will usually speak just one language.
Yes, you might provide language-specific SDKs for your service, but that&rsquo;s just
an option.</p>

<p>Do you need to hold state? If you do, most of the time, a service will be
a better option. With state comes responsibility, however. You have to
ensure regular backups, resilience, and maintenance, all of them at a cost.</p>

<p>The author suggests a few approaches to circumventing library limitations. Some
are reasonable, like dynamic linking where it is applicable (not all stacks
support it). Others, quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>Many factors influence the choice between service and library, use case and
prevailing circumstances being the main ones. I am not even sure they are
comparable, as they tend to solve different problems.</p>

<li id="fn:2">I know first hand. We&rsquo;ve recently been impacted by a catastrophic event that happened to one of our providers. Our services went down and, with them, a good part of our users. How we overcame the situation and what we learned in the process would probably be worth telling, maybe in a future article.
